# Directory structure
The directory structure below has been defined to hold Tranzakt code
and perhaps some files generated by user developed Tranzakt apps -
though most of the apps will be held dynamically in Tranzakt metadata database tables
(unless we develop a compiler to compile Tranzakt apps to Laravel php code
that can be executed directly rather than run by the Tranzakt runtime interpreter).

This design separates Laravel and other external open source code from Tranzakt code and from user developed code.
Wherever possible standard Laravel directory names are used to aid familiarity
as defined [here](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/structure).

For security reasons, publicly accessible webspace files are held in separate directories
from php code so that they cannot be accessed through e.g. apache/nginx webservers,
and .htaccess etc. can be used to strengthen this by invalidating any attempt to execute php files
in the public webspace and / or navigate outside the public webspace using "\..\".

* **admin** -
    contains code for the development environment which is **not** installed for a run-time environment.
    Will typically mimic most of the **core** Tranzakt-specific directories in order to hold all the Tranzakt
    development-only code. Bootstrap code will determine whether the URL/route is for admin and if so will
    bootstrap both the core & admin environments.
* **core** -
    contains all code necessary to run a predefined Tranzakt website
  * **laravel** -
      contains Laravel itself - used by both core and admin - and all additional pre-written laravel packages.
      The following directories are moved outside the Laravel directory in order to provide separation of
      Tranzakt code and Laravel code - and they are duplicated in the admin directory -
      but Laravel names are kept for the purpose of familiarity.
  * **app**
  * **bootstrap**
  * **config**
  * **database**
  * **lang**
  * **resources**
  * **routes**
  * **storage** -
      contains Tranzakt files, logs etc. of interest to Tranzakt internal developers
  * **tests** -
      unit, functional and regression tests for Tranzakt.
* **pages** -
    holds static page definitions when Tranzakt is used stand-alone rather than RPC from a CMS
* **public** -
    the root webspace directory for the webserver - holds all publicly accessible static files
    separate from php files which for security reasons are not directly accessible from the webserver
  * **admin** -
      if needed (TBD) holds admin-specific static files that need to be served
  * **css**
  * **js**
  * **media** -
      images, sounds, videos etc. provided by the developer
  * **uploads** -
      user uploaded files which are publicly downloadable (if you know the URL)
* **storage** -
    contains user-app files, logs etc. of interest to Tranzakt user-app developers
* **uploads** -
    optional directory to hold user uploaded files that for security reasons should not be accessible by other users.
    These files will need to be specially served by Tranzakt since they cannot be directly downloaded by the browser.
