# The `Database` Directory
The `core/database` directory contains Tranzakt's model factories, database migrations, and seeds.

In the future, if Tranzakt supports SQLite database, the default file containing empty tables
may also be held here and copied to a live file in `storage` if it doesn't already exist.
