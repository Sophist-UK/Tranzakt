# The `uploads` Directory
This `uploads` directory is a Runtime directory holding e.g.
user files uploaded by users of Tranzakt developed applications
that the Tranzakt developed application does not want publicly accessible directly
by the browser.

Files uploaded to this directory will require php functionality to be accessible to users.

`public/uploads` provides a place for user files to be uploaded which will be
publicly downloadable from a browser (if you know the URL).
