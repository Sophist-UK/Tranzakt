# The `Models` Directory
The `core/app/Models` directory contains most of Tranzakt's Eloquent (database) model classes.
`admin/app/Models` may contain additional model classes.

The Eloquent ORM included with Laravel provides a beautiful, simple
ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database.
Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table.
Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.
