# The `Exceptions` Directory
Tranzakt uses exceptions reasonably extensively in order to provide
a standardized way of handling errors by extending the Handler class in this directory.

The `core/app/Exceptions` directory contains Tranzakt runtime's exception handlers.
Exception handlers for Tranzakt development are held in `admin/app/Exceptions`.
