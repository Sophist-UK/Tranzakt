# The `core` Directory
The `core` directory holds all the code for Tranzakt Runtime, and is essentially a Laravel
root directory.

The namespace root for Tranzakt Runtime classes is `\App\Run\*`.
The namespace root for Tranzakt Developer classes is `\App\Dev\*`.

The only file in this directory is .env containing core settings for Laravel.
