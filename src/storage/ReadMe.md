# The `storage` Directory
Laravel uses `storage` to hold all dynamic run-time files
that should not be overwritten by new source files when
a new version of the app is deployed.

Normally this Laravel storage directory contains:
* logs
* compiled Blade templates
* file based sessions
* file caches
* other files generated by the framework.

This Laravel directory is usually segregated into `app`, `framework`, and `logs` sub-directories.

The `app` sub-directory may be used to store any files generated by your application.

The `framework` directory is used to store framework generated files and caches.

Finally, the `logs` directory contains your application's log files.

The intention will be to ensure through configuration and coding that this directory
segregates into separate directories the run-time files relating to the following:

* Tranzakt Runtime
* Tranzakt Developer
* Tranzakt Compiler
* User developed Tranzakt applications.
